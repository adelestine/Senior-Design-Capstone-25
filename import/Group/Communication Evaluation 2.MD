# Communicaiton Evaluation 2 and Expectations for Spring

As Winter quarter has wained to a close, I (Astrid) am writing this document because the team belives we need to re-evalueate expectations, and communication standards.
Kaye and I have slipped, several times. And while I cannot remember the spesifics of any but the most recent, I know that it has been pretty consistant, espically when it comes to group assingments. See Anecdote I and Anecdote II

#### Anecdotes
Anecdote I: on 10/26/2023 both Caleb and Astrid slept through our scheduled meeting time. This was not the first time this happened, and both Caleb and I realized that we need to be putting more effort into the team. We are all happy to talk about this and how we will be moving forward as a group, and mitigating problems like this in the future.
Anecdote II: The evening of when the Project Doc Final Submission was due (3/14/2023) and the days leading up to it.

    AD: I can only speak to my experience as I do not know what the other members had going on nor do I wish to impede their lives. This being said I knew that Savannah was going to be out of town, and had put some work in prior to leaving. I was unaware how much work and the caliber of the expected work in this assignment. I neglected to look at what the rubric for this assignment was requiring us to do and complete, at least until the night before it was due. When I did end up looking at the requirements for this assignment, I came to the internal conclusion that 90% of my work had already been completed, I just needed to integrate my work into the main project document with everyone else's. Unfortunately I was wrong, and I had only about 1/2 of my blocks completed in their writing counterparts. In the future, I will take a look at the rubric before making decisions like this.

    While I helped to fix the other parts of the document that I had originally played a part in earlier on I came to another realization. There had been some major miscommunication with regards to the blocks that were going on the final project document. I had neglected to remove the blocks that I was not referencing directly or that were deprecated, from the website, therefore other team members, rightly thinking that these blocks would be part of the final project created interfaces with them. Due to this there were several discrepancies that either needed to be corrected or accounted for in that final project document. By the time the clock struck midnight and the assignment was turned in, I had connected the two blocks that I had initially written and none others. I had also updated the block description overviews for all of the blocks I was championing. This is far from where I had wanted to be, however, after looking at the rubric and balancing my odds I found that those would be the most worth my time. Additionally I spent approxamately 5 hours in total assisting Kaye in correctly identifying exactly what was due and what work they needed to complete. If I had not done this, the overall project would be in a worse state. I also realize that if I had not done this, my parts would shine more, and I would most likely be able to complete my blocks to a more acceptable degree.
